# inet4031-lab4-website

This repository contains **my Lab 4 website** for INET 4031.  
The goal of this lab was to practice working with GitHub, cloning repositories, and modifying a local HTML file to make it my own.

The webpage demonstrates:
- How a local `.html` file can be opened in a browser (no internet needed).
- The difference between **HTML** (declarative structure) and **JavaScript** (imperative interaction).
- A simple example of turning a light bulb image on and off using JavaScript.

## How to View the Page
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `webpagewithjs.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Click the ON/OFF buttons to see the lightbulb toggle.

## Files
- `webpagewithjs.html` — HTML + CSS + JS combined page.
- `pic_bulboff.gif` / `pic_bulbon.gif` — images for the lightbulb.
